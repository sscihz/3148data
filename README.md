The [Quality of Government Data ](https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data)provides open-access datasets designed to enhance understanding of Quality of Government (QoG) concepts, divided into **Compilation Datasets** and  **Original Content Datasets** . The Compilation Datasets draw from over one hundred sources, featuring the acclaimed  **QoG Standard Dataset** , the streamlined  **QoG Basic Dataset** , the **QoG OECD Dataset** focused on member states, and the  **EU Regional Data** , which includes around 450 variables across various European administrative levels. The Original Content Datasets, created by QoG researchers, explore topics like governance quality and transparency, including the **QoG Expert Survey** with insights from global public administration experts, the **European Quality of Government Index (EQI)** based on citizen perceptions of public services, and the  **Swedish Agency Database** , which details administrative agencies in Sweden from 1960 to 2014. Together, these datasets are invaluable for researchers and practitioners examining the intricacies of government quality and public administration.

**Freedom House Data**

The *[Freedom in the World](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world) *report is composed of numerical ratings and supporting descriptive texts for 195 countries and 15 territories. External analysts assess 210 countries and territories, using a combination of on-the-ground research, consultations with local contacts, and information from news articles, nongovernmental organizations, governments, and a variety of other sources. Expert advisers and regional specialists then vet the analysts’ conclusions. The final product represents the consensus of the analysts, advisers, and Freedom House staff.

For each country and territory, *Freedom in the World* analyzes the electoral process, political pluralism and participation, the functioning of the government, freedom of expression and of belief, associational and organizational rights, the rule of law, and personal autonomy and individual rights.
